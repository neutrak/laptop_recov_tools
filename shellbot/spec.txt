This is just a little bot to allow shell access via IRC (so ports don't have to be forwarded).

It is not secure and should not be run in normal operation.  

It is being made so that a stolen laptop, tablet, or phone can run commands of the rightful owner.  
	As such, it is expected to auto-start on guest account login and be invisible to non-technical users (obviously ps will still show it).
