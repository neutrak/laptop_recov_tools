This is intended to be a simple activity logger that will be used for guest/unprivileged accounts on laptops in order to log what happens in case they get stolen.
It will depend on a log server being active that it can connect to.  

The intention is to do the following:
	log the IP address any time the user connects to the internet
	periodically upload photos from campics
	save a list of urls that are visited
